# Git vs. Google Docs, Dropbox, and Box

As a last topic of background, we wanted to address a question that often often comes up in collaboration with other senior colleagues and students. "Why not just use {term}`Google Docs`, {term}`Dropbox`, or {term}`Box, Inc.`?" These three file sharing and collaboration services could be loosely categorized under the {term}`version control system` (VCS) rubric as {term}`centralized version control system`s (CVCS). Refer to Chapter {ref}`chap_VCgitHist` for more on version control methods.

<!-- These two \git alternatives are file storage systems that automatically sync changes to files across multiple storage locations of a single user or across many users. For simple file sharing, storage, and syncing, Google Docs and Dropbox are often preferred to \git. But for projects in which hierarchical permissions of who can edit, careful tracking of contribution attribution, and version history are important, \git is preferred.

Dropbox is nice because changes to a shared document on one person's machine are automatically updated on another person's machine. Dropbox offers some storage of previous versions of files. But it does not have detailed description and does not go back very far. Furthermore, Dropbox has trouble merging changes to a document that happen simultaneously. Suppose that you and your collaborator open a shared document simultaneously on your respective machines, and you both make changes to that document. Dropbox does not know whose changes dominate, so it updates the main document with the changes of whoever saves first and then makes a ``conflicted copy'' from the saved changes of whoever saves last. It is then up to the user to figure out how to manually merge those two files.

Google Docs have no merging problem because the document is automatically updated in real time on each user's computer, regardless of whether the document has been opened or not. This is made possible because a Google Doc resides primarily on remote Google servers. Despite this remote predominance, Google Docs do allow users to store copies of the files on their local drives to be able to use the documents while off-line. To a slightly greater degree than Dropbox, Google Docs allow some version history of who made changes, as well as a nice chat and comment interface for collaboration. But in Google Docs, everybody often has the same level of permission on making changes.

\git requires more deliberate decisions and effort about what gets merged, what does not get merged. And git has more specific rules about who decides what gets incorporated into the code and what does not. But with this extra complexity comes extra order, which is essential for large projects with lots of contributors. Additionally, \git provides a more specific version history with more refined ability to revert your code to a particular point in that history.

\git, Dropbox, and Google Docs each have different strengths and weaknesses. But \git is the standard for large projects with many contributors and a need for careful version control, changelog history, and contribution attribution. -->
