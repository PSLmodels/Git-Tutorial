# Git and GitHub Tutorial Introduction

Two warnings that a seasoned Git and GitHub user should always give a new entrant to this type of version control and code collaboration are the following.
* The learning curve is steep.
* The workflow initially is not intuitive.

However, once you begin collaborating on open source projects or on large-group academic projects, you start to see the value of all the different steps, forms, and safeguards.

This tutorial reference book grew out of our recurring need to train new collaborators in the general usage of Git and GitHub as well as in the specific workflows we follow with this software and cloud platform.
