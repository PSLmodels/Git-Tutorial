# Create GitHub account

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) at Github.com to create an account.

Most likely, the free organization account will be the right place to start for you.  We recommend choosing a username suitable for a professional setting, as this will be your public profile on GitHub.
