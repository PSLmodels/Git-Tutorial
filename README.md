# Git-Tutorial (*IN PROGRESS*)
This repository will house the `Git` and [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) tutorial and training that all contributors to the [PSLmodels]() community use. This project uses [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) to create the HTML and Jupyter notebook forms of the tutorial. We hope to add tutorial videos at some point in the future.
