# Git and GitHub Tutorial Introduction

This Git and GitHub tutorial grew out of training needs that constantly recurred and overlapped in our collaborative circles. We would need to train any new collaborators on [Policy Simulation Library](https://github.com/PSLmodels) incubated projects on the Git and GitHub workflow we used. Since 2013, the authors have been training students, faculty, policy makers, other researchers how to collaborate on research and code using Git and GitHub. Until now, the materials we would use to train our collaborators were pieced together from a number of great sources. This book represents the consolidation of those resources and our experience together in one place.

Two warnings that a seasoned Git and GitHub user should always give a new entrant to this type of version control and code collaboration are the following.
* The learning curve is steep.
* The workflow initially is not intuitive.

These two obstacles seem to work together to make this form of collaboration harder than the sum of their parts initially. However, once you begin collaborating on open source projects or on large-group academic or research projects, you start to see the value of all the different steps, methods, and safeguards invoved with using Git and GitHub.


## Brief Definitions of Git and GitHub

Before we move on with the introduction and the rest of this book, we want to give the reader a quick reference, definition, and comparison of Git and GitHub. We will spend entire chapters on these two topics in {ref}`chap_GitHist` and {ref}`chap_GitHubHist`. But we want to give a brief reference here at the beginning.

```{admonition} Definition: {term}`Git`
Git is an open source distributed version control software that resides on your local computer and tracks changes and the history of changes to all the files in a directory. See the Git website [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and the [Git Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) {cite}`GitWiki:2020` for more information.
```

```{admonition} Definition: {term}`GitHub.com`
GitHub.com is an open source distributed version control software that resides on your local computer and tracks changes and the history of changes to all the files in a directory.
```

To be clear at the outset, Git is the version control software that resides on your local computer. It's main functionalities are to track changes in the files in specified directories. But Git also has some functionality to talk to remote

## Wide usage
Every year in November, GitHub publishes are report entitled, "The State of the Octoverse", in which they detail the growth and developments in the GitHub community in the most recent year. The most recent [State of the Octoverse](https://github.blog/2019-11-06-the-state-of-the-octoverse-2019/) was published on November 6, 2019 and covered developments from October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019. Some interesting statistics from that report are the following.

* more than 40 million GitHub user accounts
* more than 44 million code repositories

## Open source, Policy Simulation Library, Research, and Collaboration

Finish this preface with a big-picture discussion of where Git and GitHub fit in the broader open source, policy, research, collaboration setting. Discussion of PSLmodels goals, scalable collaboration, precise attribution, open source ethos, heirarchical protection of code, testing, documentation, best practices, harmonization of convention, ease of participation, modularity, crowd sourcing contributions.
