Code documentation standards, README.md, Jupyter Book, actual books/manual, Sphinx

The [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) documentation has a section in the [MyST Markdown Overview](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html) chapter suggesting that if you are using VS Code to modify markdown files, you should download the [vscode MyST markdown extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ExecutableBookProject.myst-highlight) that provides highlighting and other features.
