# History of GitHub

In the [previous chapter](https://pslmodels.github.io/Git-Tutorial/content/background/VCgitHistory.html), we defined and described the three main categories of {term}`version control system`s. We documented the history of {term}`Git` {term}`distributed version control system` (DVCS) and how the current state of Git is really an outgrowth generally of the history of {term}`open source` development and specifically of the development of the open source Linux operating system kernel.

```{admonition} Definition: GitHub
:class: note
{term}`GitHub` or [*GitHub.com*](https://github.com/) is a {term}`cloud` {term}`source code management service` platform designed to enable scalable, efficient, and secure version controlled collaboration by linking {term}`local` {term}`Git` version controlled software development by users. *GitHub*'s main business footprint is hosting a collection of millions of version controlled code repositories. In addition to being a platform for {term}`distributed version control system` (DVCS), *GitHub*'s primary features include code review, project management, {term}`continuous integration` {term}`unit testing`, {term}`GitHub actions`, and associated web page (GitHub pages) and documentation hosting and deployment.
```

As we described in the [last chapter](https://pslmodels.github.io/Git-Tutorial/content/background/VCgitHistory.html) when the development of the {term}`Linux` kernel separated from using the {term}`Bitkeeper` {term}`distributed version control system` (DVCS), Linus Torvalds began work writing his own DVCS software. In the first few years, the Git DVCS software was "self hosting" using a coordinating Linux server. However, it quickly became apparent that a more flexible and scalable central {term}`cloud` service was needed.

The company, GitHub, Inc., was formed in 2007 by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon, and the GitHub service was rolled out in February 2008 {cite}`GitHubWiki2020`.

Give a history of GitHub or GitHub.com. Show and describe how GitHub allows Git to be collaborative, specific heirarchical permission structure, describe other platforms, e.g. BitBucket, SVN.
